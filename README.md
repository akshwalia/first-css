Hey there, I'll now be building my first styled webpage. Just finished learning the basics of CSS, very excited to showcase it with this webpage. 
I am very sure it is not going to be easy having learnt so much in a week, but I'll try my best. 
It is 2:40 AM rn, and I couldn't hold the excitement in, so here I go, sleep what?
